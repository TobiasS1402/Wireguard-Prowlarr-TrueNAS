# SIGNATURE: certifies the payload originates from the PIA network.

# Basically PAYLOAD+SIGNATURE=PORT. You can use the same PORT on all servers.
# The system has been designed to be completely decentralized, so that your
# privacy is protected even if you want to host services on your systems.

# You can get your PAYLOAD+SIGNATURE with a simple curl request to any VPN
# gateway, no matter what protocol you are using. Considering WireGuard has
# already been automated in this repo, here is a command to help you get
# your gateway if you have an active OpenVPN connection:
# $ ip route | head -1 | grep tun | awk '{ print $3 }'
# This section will get updated as soon as we created the OpenVPN script.

# Get the payload and the signature from the PF API. This will grant you
# access to a random port, which you can activate on any server you connect to.
# If you already have a signature, and you would like to re-use that port,
# save the payload_and_signature received from your previous request
# in the env var PAYLOAD_AND_SIGNATURE, and that will be used instead.
